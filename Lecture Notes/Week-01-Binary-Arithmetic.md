# II. Understanding Number Systems

## Introduction to Number Systems

In computing, numbers can be represented in various bases or number systems. The most common are binary (base 2), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16). Understanding how these systems work is crucial for understanding computational processes.

## Binary System (Base 2)

### Representation
- Binary digits (bits): {0, 1}
- Example of binary to decimal conversion: 
    - Binary: 10101101
    - Decimal: 173 (1×2^7 + 0×2^6 + 1×2^5 + 0×2^4 + 1×2^3 + 1×2^2 + 0×2^1 + 1×2^0)

### Conversion from Decimal to Binary
- Divide the decimal number by 2, note the remainder, and use the quotient for the next division, until the quotient is zero. The binary number is the string of remainders read in reverse order.
- Example: Convert 47 to binary:
    - 47 ÷ 2 = 23 remainder 1
    - 23 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 1
    - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1
    - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1
    - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0
    - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
    - Binary representation: 101111

### Arithmetic Operations
- Addition and multiplication in binary follow similar rules as in decimal but are simpler due to the use of only two digits (0 and 1).

## Decimal System (Base 10)

### Representation
- Decimal digits: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Example of decimal representation: 
    - Decimal: 453
    - Expanded Form: 4×10^2 + 5×10^1 + 3×10^0

### Conversion from Decimal to Other Bases

## Conclusion

Understanding the number systems and how they are represented and manipulated in computing is fundamental for anyone delving into the computer science and engineering fields. This knowledge forms the basis for understanding more complex computational concepts and operations.

# III. Binary Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction

Binary arithmetic is fundamental in computing as it forms the basis of numerical calculations in digital systems. It operates on binary digits (bits), which are 0 and 1. Mastering binary arithmetic operations is crucial for understanding and designing digital circuits and systems. This section explores the core binary arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with certain considerations and special cases.

## Binary Addition

### Basic Addition
- **0 + 0 = 0**
- **0 + 1 = 1**
- **1 + 0 = 1**
- **1 + 1 = 10** (0 carry 1)

### Carry-Out
- When adding two binary digits, if the sum equals or exceeds the base (2), a carry-out is generated.
- Example: 
    - Add 1011 and 1101
    - Solution: 
        - Starting from the rightmost bit, 
            - 1 + 1 = 10 (0 carry 1)
            - 1 + 0 + carry 1 = 10 (0 carry 1)
            - 0 + 1 + carry 1 = 10 (0 carry 1)
            - 1 + 1 + carry 1 = 11 (1 carry 1)
        - Result: 11000

## Binary Subtraction

### Basic Subtraction
- **0 - 0 = 0**
- **1 - 0 = 1**
- **1 - 1 = 0**
- **0 - 1 requires borrowing**

### Borrowing
- Borrowing is similar to decimal subtraction where a borrow from the next left bit is needed when subtracting a larger digit from a smaller digit.
- Example:
    - Subtract 0110 from 1001
    - Solution:
        - Starting from the rightmost bit,
            - 1 - 0 = 1
            - 0 - 1 requires borrowing, making it 10 - 1 = 1
            - 0 (after borrowing becomes 10) - 1 = 1
            - 1 - 0 = 1
        - Result: 0011

## Binary Multiplication

### Basic Multiplication
- **0 × 0 = 0**
- **0 × 1 = 0**
- **1 × 0 = 0**
- **1 × 1 = 1**

### Multiplication Operation
- Similar to decimal multiplication but simpler due to the absence of multiple multiplication tables.
- Example:
    - Multiply 1011 by 1101
    - Solution:
        - Multiply each bit of the multiplier by the multiplicand and add the results, shifting one position to the left each time.
        - Result: 10011111

## Binary Division

### Basic Division
- Similar to long division in decimal but simpler due to the absence of multiple division tables.
- Example:
    - Divide 11010 by 101
    - Solution:
        - The procedure follows long division where the divisor is subtracted from the dividend, and the quotient is built bit by bit.
        - Result: Quotient = 101, Remainder = 011

## Special Considerations

### Two's Complement for Handling Negative Numbers
- Two's Complement notation is used to represent negative numbers, which simplifies the hardware implementation of subtraction.

### Overflow and Underflow
- Overflow and underflow are common issues in binary arithmetic that occur when the result of an operation is too large or too small to be represented within the designated number of bits.

## Conclusion

Binary arithmetic operations form the core of computation in digital systems. Understanding these operations is vital for anyone looking to delve deeper into computer science and digital design. Through mastering binary addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, one can gain a solid foundation for exploring more complex computational concepts and digital system designs.

# V. Two’s Complement and Negative Numbers

## Introduction

In the realm of digital computers, numbers are represented using binary digits (bits). The representation of negative numbers in a binary system is a critical concept, enabling arithmetic operations including subtraction. Two's complement is the most common method employed for this purpose due to its simplicity and efficiency in hardware implementation.

## Concept of Two’s Complement

### Definition
Two's complement is a method of representing signed integers in binary form, facilitating straightforward arithmetic operations. In this system, the leftmost bit denotes the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), while the remaining bits represent the absolute value of the number in binary.

### Calculation
The two’s complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all the bits (changing 0s to 1s and vice versa) and then adding 1 to the result. 

- **Inversion:** 
    - Original: 0101101
    - Inverted: 1010010

- **Adding 1:**
    - Result: 1010011

### Range of Representable Numbers
In an n-bit two's complement representation, the range of representable numbers is from -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1.

- **Example:** 
    - For an 8-bit number: Range is from -128 to 127.

## Advantages of Two’s Complement

### Simplicity in Arithmetic Operations
Two’s complement representation simplifies the hardware design for arithmetic operations, especially subtraction. Subtraction is performed by adding the two’s complement of the subtrahend to the minuend.

- **Example:**
    - To compute A - B, calculate A + (Two’s Complement of B).

### Elimination of Redundancy
Unlike the sign-magnitude representation, two’s complement has only one representation for zero and does not have negative zero, eliminating redundancy.

## Conversion Between Decimal and Two's Complement

### From Decimal to Two’s Complement
1. **Positive Numbers:** 
    - Direct binary representation.
2. **Negative Numbers:** 
    - Find the binary representation of the absolute value.
    - Invert the bits.
    - Add 1.

### From Two’s Complement to Decimal

    - Convert to decimal and negate.

## Overflow in Two's Complement Arithmetic

Overflow occurs when a calculation yields a result outside the range of representable numbers. It's crucial to detect and handle overflow to ensure accurate computations.

- **Example:**
    - Adding two large positive numbers in two's complement representation can result in a negative number due to overflow.

## Conclusion

The two’s complement system is an elegant method for representing and manipulating negative numbers in binary form. Its ability to simplify arithmetic operations, combined with its efficiency in hardware implementation, makes it a fundamental concept in computer science and digital design. Understanding two’s complement representation is crucial for anyone working with digital systems and aiming to grasp more advanced computational concepts.
